# GpsLocationService
<h3>This is an android application that uses Android Services, Geolocation, Google Maps and Retrofit to achieve it's goal.</h3>

<p>Let's make a short brief.</p> 
<p>I have already built a system with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Esp8266 and Wifi Relay Module that opens the electronic lock in my main door. <br>
So now i made this application so it can monitor my location and with the use of <strong>Geofencing Api</strong> makes an api call in the server and opens the door
without my interaction. <br> <br>
The service that runs the Geofencing Api is running always even in the background or if the user kills the app. Also provides to the user the option to start or stop
manually the service in his preference. </p>
